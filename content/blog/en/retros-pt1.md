# Async retrospectives

_How to stop wasting time filling the board and start using it for what matters_

The first retro of the sprint started the same as always. Silence.

Not because the team had nothing to say, but because nobody quite remembered what had happened the week before. Someone asked "what went wrong this week?" and there was a long moment where everyone looked at the empty board as if waiting for it to fill itself.

We'd been like that for months. And at some point I realized the problem wasn't the people, it was the format.

## What we ask of memory

A classic retrospective works like this: you finish the sprint, you gather the team, and right when everyone is most tired and already thinking about the next cycle, you ask them to remember and summarize two weeks of work.

There's an argument that sounds reasonable: _"if it was important, they'll remember it"_. And there's some truth to that. But it's also a way of leaving value on the table.

Because often the most useful things to improve aren't the big events but the small frictions: the communication that didn't flow on a Tuesday, the task that was blocked for two days by a dependency nobody mentioned, the decision that was made in the wrong channel. Those things get lost. Not because they don't matter, but because memory isn't designed to retain everyday detail for two weeks.

## The proposal

One day I showed up to the planning meeting with a single question: _"What if during the sprint we write down the things that seem important as they happen, and we come to the retro with that?"_

No new tools, no elaborate process. And no pressure to write something every day.

That last part matters. The idea isn't to force yourself to log one thing per day as if it were another sprint task. It's the opposite: when something catches your attention—a friction, a decision that went well, something you wish you'd done differently—you note it in that moment, because that's when it's fresh. If the sprint goes by without friction, the board can end up with little on it. And that's fine.

The structure is minimal: three columns.

- **What went well?**
- **What didn't go so well?**
- **What do I wish I'd done differently?**

On retro day, you show up with what was worth capturing. The meeting stops being a memory exercise and becomes what it always should have been: a conversation about what's already on the table.

## The variant that worked best for us

There's a version of this that's even more efficient, and it's the one we ended up adopting: at the end of each retro, we share the next retro's board directly.

The next retro's board stays open from that moment. Everyone can add notes there during the sprint, in real time, with no need to transcribe anything on the day of the meeting. What you see on the board on retro day is exactly what will be discussed, with no intermediate steps.

The result is that the meeting starts straight into the conversation. There's no "now fill out the board" phase. The board is already complete, or as complete as the sprint warranted.

## How it was adopted on the team

The good thing about this dynamic is that it spreads.

At first we were eight people and half used the board. Nobody had to be convinced and there was no meeting to explain the process. Simply, those who used it showed up to the retro with more to say, with more context, and the session felt different. Lighter. Little by little the rest joined in.

The number that best reflects it is time. Filling the board in the retro used to take 15 to 20 minutes. With this dynamic that step takes 3 or 5 minutes, because it's basically already done. And you notice it in how the meeting feels: you stop walking in with the burden of having to remember and be decisive at the same time. You only have to be decisive.

That, more than anything else, is the sign that something started to work.

## What to keep in mind

The first few weeks it's hard to remember to log in the moment. The natural impulse is to think "I'll note this later", and later it doesn't matter as much or you simply forget. Over time that adjusts on its own.

The important thing is not to turn it into a bureaucratic obligation. If someone feels they have to write something even when there's nothing relevant, something is wrong. The board isn't a form. It's a place to land what you would have wanted to say in the retro anyway.

## The board isn't the goal

The async retro doesn't replace the conversation. The board is a starting point, not the end product.

The meeting is still necessary. The real-time discussion, the chance to connect the dots between what one person lived and what another lived, the collective agreement on what to change—no board solves that.

What changes is the proportion of time. Less time filling, more time talking.

If you want to try it, the easiest path is to show up to the next retro with your own notes from the sprint, without asking anything of the team yet. Often that alone is enough to spark curiosity in the rest.

# Async retrospectives

_How to stop wasting time filling the board and start using it for what matters_

---

While working at Voxel Group I realized something that, in hindsight (pun intended), was pretty obvious. Retrospectives were getting long. Not because the team had too much to say, but because we reached the end of the sprint with an empty head.

Two weeks of work compressed into one hour. And the first twenty minutes were always the same. Silence, someone asking "what happened this week?", and an attempt to reconstruct from memory everything that had happened since the last retro.

The problem wasn't the people. It was the format. So I decided to propose something different.

## The problem with traditional retros

A classic retrospective works like this. You finish the sprint, you gather the team, and right when everyone is the most tired and already thinking about the next cycle, you ask them to remember and summarize two weeks of work.

It's a memory exercise competing with fatigue, the pressure of the next sprint, and the mental speed each person happens to have that day.

There's an argument that sounds reasonable: _"if it was important, they'll remember it"_. And there's some truth to it. But it's also a way of leaving value on the table. Because many of the most useful things to improve aren't the big events but the small frictions, the micro-misalignments, the decisions that felt minor in the moment and two weeks later reveal themselves as patterns.

Those things get lost. Not because they don't matter, but because memory isn't designed to retain everyday detail for two weeks.

## The idea: spread the load over time

The solution we found was simple. Instead of trying to remember everything in one sitting, capture it as you go.

The concrete mechanism is pretty straightforward.

**At the start of each sprint**, we create a new board. In our case we used Miro, but it doesn't require any particular tool. A note in Notion, a page in Obsidian, a piece of paper stuck to the monitor, or whatever system works for each person and the team.

The structure is minimal. Three columns.

- **What went well?**
- **What didn't go so well?**
- **What do I wish I'd done differently?**

**During the sprint**, at the end of each day or every couple of days, each team member asks themselves those questions. It doesn't have to be exhaustive or take more than five minutes. It's just capturing what's fresh before it evaporates.

**On retro day**, you show up with the board already half full. The meeting stops being a memory exercise and becomes what it always should have been: a conversation about what's already on the table.

## What changes in practice

The most immediate change is time. When the board already has content, the first twenty minutes of silence disappear. The meeting can start straight with the discussion.

But there's something more important than time: the quality of what's on the board.

Traditional retros tend to capture the big events — the production incident, the architectural decision that went wrong, the deadline that moved. Async retros also capture the small stuff: the communication that didn't flow on a Tuesday, the task that was blocked for two days by a dependency nobody mentioned, the decision that got made in the wrong channel.

Those details are often where the most concrete, actionable improvements live.

## For the team and for leadership

For the team, the benefit is direct. Less pressure in the meeting, more space to think during the sprint, and the sense that what you say is backed by reality, not just "whatever you came up with on the spot".

For whoever leads or facilitates, the change is just as valuable. A board built during the sprint is a more honest signal of team health than one put together under pressure. Patterns are easier to see. And facilitation can prepare better when you already know what topics will dominate the conversation.

## What to keep in mind

Like any process change, this requires some initial discipline. The first weeks it's hard to remember to log things. That's normal.

Some teams find it useful to add a daily reminder, or to make logging an explicit part of end-of-day. Others incorporate it naturally after a sprint or two.

The important part is not turning it into another bureaucratic obligation. If logging feels like a burden, something isn't working. It could be the frequency, the board structure, or the team culture around retros.

The goal isn't to have the fullest board. It's to get to the retro with less friction and more clarity.

---

## The board isn't the goal, it's the tool

It's worth making it explicit. An async retro doesn't replace the conversation. The board is a starting point, not the end product.

The meeting is still necessary. The real-time discussion, the ability to connect the dots between what one person lived and what another lived, the collective agreement on what to change... no board solves that.

What changes is the proportion of time. Less time filling, more time talking. Less effort remembering, more energy solving.

## How to start

When I proposed this at Voxel, I didn't show up with an elaborate process or a presentation. I showed up with a question. _"What happens if next sprint each of us writes down one thing per day and we come to retro with that?"_. No mandatory tools, no overhead. Just the habit.

That was enough to try it. And once the team experienced it, there was no need to convince anyone to keep doing it.

If you're thinking about proposing something similar in your team, that's the easiest path: start with a small question, not a new process. And if you want to start solo first, bring your own notes to the next retro and see how your experience of the meeting changes. Many times that's enough to spark curiosity in the rest.

> The best retrospectives aren't the ones that take less time. They're the ones that ask better questions. And to ask better questions, you first need to remember well.

It's one of the ideas I'm most proud of having proposed. Not because it's complex, but because it's simple, it works, and it gives the team back time and energy for what really matters.

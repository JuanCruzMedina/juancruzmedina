            Ever since I started programming, I haven&#39;t stopped learning new
            languages, techniques and technologies. I&#39;ve had the opportunity
            to work in SaaS companies, freelance projects and some larger-scale
            projects. I enjoy writing code for people, learning and sharing
            knowledge. My current focus is on leading and supporting projects as
            a coach.

            Some programmers have a rubber duck to explain their code problems
            toâ€”I have my cat, Indio. Whether he&#39;s sitting on my shoulders or
            staring at me with judgmental eyes, he&#39;s always there to listen
            to my bugs (even if he doesn&apos;t care about them). ðŸ˜¼
